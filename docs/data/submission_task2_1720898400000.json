    "questionText": "Some people believe that the government should provide free healthcare for all citizens, while others argue that individuals should be responsible for their own healthcare costs. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion."
  },
  "answer": "The debate over universal healthcare is a complex one. On one hand, providing free healthcare ensures that everyone has access to medical treatment, regardless of their income. This can lead to a healthier, more productive population. On the other hand, funding such a system requires high taxes, which can be a burden on the economy. I believe a hybrid system is the best solution.",

        "comments": "This point is valid but underdeveloped. To improve, you could explain how high taxes burden the economy. For instance, they might reduce disposable income or discourage business investment.",
        "howToRewrite": "Conversely, the implementation of a universal healthcare system necessitates significant public expenditure, typically funded through higher taxation. This can place a considerable strain on the national economy, potentially reducing citizens' disposable income and acting as a disincentive for corporate investment."
