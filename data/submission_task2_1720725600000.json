        "howToRewrite": "The proliferation of fast food, such as hamburgers and pizza, has significant health implications due to high levels of fat, salt, and sugar. In contrast, traditional meals, typically prepared at home, offer greater nutritional value. Furthermore, the practice of families cooking together not only promotes healthier eating habits but also strengthens familial bonds."
